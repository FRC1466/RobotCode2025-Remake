This section will cover the core components of the robot code, organized into three main categories:

## Subsystems
Hardware abstractions and control logic for each robot mechanism (drivetrain, vision, superstructure, etc.)

## Commands
Action sequences and behaviors that coordinate subsystems to accomplish specific tasks

## Major Independent Files
Standalone utilities, constants, and configuration files that support the overall system architecture
