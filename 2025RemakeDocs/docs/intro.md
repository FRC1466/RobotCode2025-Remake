# Introduction
Welcome to my 2025 Robot Code Remake Documentation. After the many issues with consistency and stability during the 2025 season, I wanted to rewrite the code from the ground up using modern techniques and taking inspiration from other top level teams. There will be three main parts to these docs:

1. Code Explanation: Will go file by file over the most important parts of the code. Will not explain every single util or helper, but most main subsystem code or commands.
2. Tutorials: How to replicate this feature?
3. Sources: How did I learn this, and where can you learn it too?

So, let's get started! I recommend going sequentially in folder order but it is up to you.
