This document contains basic definitions for common FRC and AdvantageKit terms.

### General Robotics & FRC

- **IO (Input/Output)**: Refers to the communication between the robot's code and its physical components. Inputs are data from sensors (e.g., encoders, gyros), and outputs are commands sent to actuators (e.g., motors, solenoids).

- **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)**: A common control loop algorithm used to bring a system to a desired setpoint and hold it there. It continuously calculates an error value and adjusts the output to minimize the error.

- **Setpoint**: The target value for a control system, such as a desired angle for an arm or a target speed for a flywheel.

- **Subsystem**: A self-contained component or mechanism of the robot, managed by its own class in the code (e.g., Drivetrain, Intake, Arm).

- **Superstructure**: The collection of all robot mechanisms, typically excluding the drivetrain. Can sometimes refer to only moving mechanisms.

- **Drivetrain / Drivebase**: The subsystem responsible for the robot's movement on the field.

- **Kinematics**: The mathematics that describes the motion of the robot. For example, drivetrain kinematics converts robot speeds (forward, sideways, turning) into individual wheel speeds.

- **Odometry**: The process of estimating the robot's position (pose) on the field over time by using data from sensors like wheel encoders and a gyroscope.

- **Pose**: A robot's position (X and Y coordinates) and heading (rotation) on the field.

- **WPILib**: The standard software library provided for FRC teams to program their robots in Java, C++, or Python.

- **CAN (Controller Area Network)**: A robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other's applications without a host computer. In FRC, it's the primary way motor controllers and some sensors are wired.

- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers.

- **Command-Based Programming**: A design pattern provided by WPILib that helps organize robot code by breaking it down into `Subsystem`s (representing physical parts of the robot) and `Command`s (representing actions the robot can take).

- **Swerve Drive**: A type of drivetrain where each wheel module can be independently steered and driven. This allows for holonomic movement, meaning the robot can move in any direction and rotate simultaneously.

- **Field-Relative Control**: A control scheme for a drivetrain (especially swerve) where joystick inputs correspond to movements relative to the field (e.g., pushing forward on the stick always moves the robot away from the driver station), regardless of the robot's orientation.

### AdvantageKit & AdvantageScope

- **AdvantageKit**: A logging framework for WPILib robots. It records detailed data from the robot, which can be "replayed" in simulation to debug code without needing the physical robot.

- **AdvantageScope**: A data visualization tool that can display live or logged robot data. It supports various views like line graphs, tables, and a 3D field view. It can be used with or without AdvantageKit.

- **Log Replay**: A core feature of AdvantageKit. It allows you to run your robot code in a desktop simulation using data previously recorded on the real robot, enabling powerful debugging.

- **Logged IO / Replayable IO**: The practice in AdvantageKit of creating an `IO` interface for each subsystem. This interface has two implementations: one for the real hardware (`RealIO`) and one for replaying logged data (`ReplayIO`). This pattern separates hardware interaction from robot logic, which is key to enabling log replay.

- **`.wpilog` file**: The log file format generated by AdvantageKit. These binary files contain all the logged data from a robot session and can be opened and analyzed with AdvantageScope.
