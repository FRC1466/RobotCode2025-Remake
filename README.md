Welcome to Team 1466 Webb Robotics' robot code for the 2025 *REEFSCAPE* game. This repository is a full reset of our previous code ([2025](https://github.com/FRC1466/robot-code-2025)) built from the ground up to reflect the changes of our software team. With an increased focus on quality, this codebase introduces numerous new features and improvements aimed at making our robot as competitive and reliable as possible.

> This repository is **active and experimental** â€” expect frequent changes as we develop throughout the off-season.

Check out our [Open Alliance build thread](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-1466-webb-robotics-2025-build-thread-open-alliance/477247) on Chief Delphi to follow our progress. You can also browse past seasons:
- [2024](https://github.com/FRC1466/robot-code-2024)
- [2023](https://github.com/FRC1466/robot-code-2023)
- [2022](https://github.com/FRC1466/robot-code-2022)

This updated software architecture has been heavily inspired by [Team 6328 Mechanical Advantage](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage), whose open-source contributions have influenced many parts of our code.
